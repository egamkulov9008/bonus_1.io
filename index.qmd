Hello! My name is Mukhammed Egamkulov, and I am a dedicated professional with a strong foundation in project management, account management, international sales, and data science. I thrive on the challenge of leveraging data to drive decision-making and enhance business processes. My passion lies in harnessing technology to solve complex problems and deliver innovative solutions.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in International Business Administration with a focus on Data Science & Decision Support at [Europa-Universität Viadrina](https://www.europa-uni.de/en/index.html) in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. Previously, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a major in Finance from [SolBridge International School](https://www.solbridge.ac.kr/story/main/index.jsp) of Business in South Korea, where I also completed an exchange semester at Buckingham University [IBS Budapest](https://www.ibs-b.hu/en/?lan=en) in Hungary.


My technical skills include proficiency in Python, R, KNIME, MySQL, and various data visualization tools. I am fluent in Uzbek, Kyrgyz, English, Russian, and Korean, with intermediate proficiency in German.
