Throughout my career, I have gained substantial experience in various roles. As a Sales Manager at [EcoRay Co. Ltd.](http://www.eco-ray.co.kr/en/) in Seoul, South Korea, I managed sales operations for CIS and European markets. At [MSBIO Inc.](http://msbio.co.kr/eng/), I promoted medical devices and human tissue products across multiple regions, including the USA, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. My tenure as an Account Manager at [Pine BM Co. Ltd.](https://en.pinebm.co.kr/) involved managing international accounts and spearheading online sales initiatives.

In addition to my professional experience, I have worked on several data-driven projects. I developed a Python-based tool to scrape, analyze, and visualize price data from various e-commerce platforms. I also built a house price prediction model using regression techniques and simulated customer traffic to improve operational efficiency in a caf√© setting.
