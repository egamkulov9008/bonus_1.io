In my free time, I enjoy staying active and mentally sharp through a variety of hobbies. I am an avid football enthusiast, both playing and watching the sport, which I find exhilarating and a great way to bond with friends and colleagues. I also have a passion for chess, enjoying the strategic depth and intellectual challenge it offers. Additionally, running is a key part of my routine, helping me stay fit and clear my mind. Whether it's hitting the football field, engaging in a chess match, or going for a run, these activities bring balance and joy to my life.
